                <p>Jennifer resides in Mesa, AZ with her loving husband, two
                    vibrant children and their yellow labrador retriever.
                    Arizona is the 10th state that Jennifer has lived in but she has clearly settled in
                    comfortably as she has lived in the valley of the sun now for over 13 years.
                    <br><br>
                    After receiving her Master's Degree in Acting from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers
                    University,
                    Jennifer found herself using her innate computer skills as an Executive Administrative Assistant at
                    Warner Brother Studios in Burbank, CA. After moving to Arizona, she continued the role of Executive
                    Administrative Assistant for a father-son financial advisor team at Wells Fargo Advisors. She also
                    started a photography business so that she would have a good excuse to play with Photoshop in
                    her spare time.
                    <br><br>
                    Being always curious to know more and a forever learner, Jennifer feels she has found her perfect
                    career path with Web Development.
                    As technology is ever-changing, Jennifer enjoys the challenge of staying up-to-date with the newest
                    software improvements and loves making the internet a little more fun, functional and beautiful...
                    one code at a time.
